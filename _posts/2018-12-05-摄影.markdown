I enjoy using semi-professional photography equipment for my shoots. My preferred subjects include environmental portrait photography and environmental photography. Thanks to fieldwork opportunities over the past few years, I have captured numerous images of the landscapes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. Additionally, I enjoy photographing urban environments and environmental portraits in bustling cities, and I also work with my friends to capture images from cosplay events. My photography skills enable me to handle conference and event photography tasks within my graduate research group.

Currently, the primary camera I use is the SONY α7R III.
