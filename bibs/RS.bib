ABSTRACT = {The escalating human pressures on natural ecosystems necessitate urgent and effective conservation strategies to safeguard biodiversity and ecosystem functions. This review explored current techniques for mapping human pressure, with a particular focus on their application in nature conservation, especially within protected areas (PAs). Specifically, we analyzed the impacts of seven major types of human pressures on nature conservation within PAs. Additionally, we discussed four key methods for mapping human pressure, including land use intensity, human footprint, digital human footprint, and other proxies, examining their distinct characteristics and respective advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, our research explored the application of human pressure mapping for nature conservation, assessing its suitability for conservation applications and delineating directions for future work. These insights contributed to better support nature conservation and the management of PAs.},
